        This code is taken from "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson.
        Few modifications are done to make this code suitable for teaching modern
        binary exploitation on both 32 and 64 bit architectures.

        NOTE to Jon Erickson
        Can't thank you enough for writing this amazing book and sharing your
        perspective in the field of binary exploitation. I'm quite sure the world
        continues to learn from your experience !
